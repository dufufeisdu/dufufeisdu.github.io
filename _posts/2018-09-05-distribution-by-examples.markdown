## **discrete distribution**
### *unform distribution
Question: Throwing a __fair__ dice once, what is the probability(p) that the dice top is 6? How about 5? 4,..1?

  ** **
Remember it is a fair dice,so every side have the equal chance to be the top.

The distrubution is like this :
<table>
<caption>unform distribution</caption>
<tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th> <tr>
<tr><td>1/6</td><td>1/6</td><td>1/6</td><td>1/6</td><td>1/6</td><td>1/6</td><tr>
</table>
